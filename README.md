> This is a online sticker board, it syncs to the database on save and can dinamically create new boards to be used. This project was created in under 24h as personal challange. The main lessons that were learned in this project were the usefulness of state managment (This will be the next topic I will be learning more in depth) and componentization, that allowed me to reuse components in my pages that otherwise would have taken me some time to replicate and adapt, and would have made my code clunkier.

> Another big challange that I faced was the relations between the tables. It was difficult but very interesting and usefull for future projects!
